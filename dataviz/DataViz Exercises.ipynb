    "## Exercise 1. Redlining\n",
    "\n",
    "Back during the New Deal of the 1930s, there was a housing shortage, and the Home-Owner's Loan Corporation (HOLC) was formed by the U.S. government to make housing more attainable by working-class and middle-class (but not poor) families. As part of that work, they graded neighborhoods on their perceived risk of failure to repay a loan, from \"A\", the best grade colored green on the maps to \"D\", deemed \"hazardous\" and [colored red](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redlining/images/00-cleveland-scan.jpg?v=9dfaacc7), and thus called \"redlining.\" Mitigating loan risk is not bad in and of itself, but the HOLC's policies were explicitly racist: they gave guidance that \"incompatible racial groups should not be permitted to live in the same communities\" and were built on the belief that \"the presence of any population of Black residents was a sign of impending property value decline.\" (Jackson 2021). Loans were systematically denied to Black families, especially if they were attempting to buy homes in white neighborhoods. Later, private banks used the maps produced by the HOLC and perpetuated these practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "While redlining is now illegal—and has been for over 50 years—we can still see patterns of segregation enacted and reinforced by the HOLC in the 1930s. In this exercise, you'll be exploring the connections between the original HOLC grades and racial data from the 2020 census of those metropolitan areas.\n",
